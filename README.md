In this project, I designed a circuit using a photoresistor and a PN2222 transistor to automatically control LEDs based on ambient light levels. The circuit operates 
on the principle that current follows the path of least resistance. When the photoresistor detects high ambient light, its resistance decreases, allowing current to 
bypass the transistor, preventing the LED from turning on. Conversely, in low ambient light conditions, the photoresistor's resistance increases, redirecting current 
to the base of the transistor. This action completes the circuit, allowing current to flow through the LED, thus illuminating it in darker environments. This design 
demonstrates the application of analog sensing and transistor switching in practical circuits.
